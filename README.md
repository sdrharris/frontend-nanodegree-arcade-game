Classic Arcade Game 

This game consist of a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal is to get the player from the grassy knoll, across the stone blocks, and to the river without colliding with the enemy. Remember, the enemies are moving at various speeds and if you collide with one you'll be returned to the grassy knoll. However, your mission is to reach the river without encountering the enemy. Use you arrow keys to move the player up, down, left, or right. Once you reach the water, you've won and the game is reset.
